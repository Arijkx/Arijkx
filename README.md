### Who is Arijkx?

I’m a pixel artist – yes, that still exists, and I love creating big art with tiny squares. Here, I present some of my creations, inspired by old video games that probably make you as nostalgic as the dust on your Gameboy.

My passion lies mainly in futuristic spaceships and epic space battles. Why? Because the universe is just way cooler than regular life. For my drawings, I mostly use **Aseprite** – a program that's probably as fun as a space adventure. Before that, I was a loyal Adobe Photoshop user until I realized pixel art involves fewer pixels and a lot more fun.

What’s my goal? To offer you artwork that you can enjoy and hopefully use. Now and then, I throw up a free asset pack on **[itch.io](https://arijkx.itch.io/)**, because nothing’s more fun than giving something away and seeing it get used. If you like it – great! If not – well, at least it was free.

On the side, I’m also trying, like many other artists, to dip my toes into game development. As a passionate gamer (and probably a bit frustrated by the industry), I dream of creating my own game ideas. Yeah, I’m the kind of person who thinks they can make a game that isn’t dependent on microtransactions. But hey, these are just hobby projects, so no worries – you’ll see more eventually.

I hope my art speaks to you. Or maybe not. But hey, leave a comment and tell me what you think – constructive criticism is like good coffee: bitter, but necessary.

Thanks for stopping by – enjoy exploring my pixel art. And if not, feel free to swing by again. Maybe I’ll find the “right” pixel someday. 😊
